# Introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to Bookfindr.

Bookfindr is an open source project and I will love to receive contributions from the open-source community, which includes â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into the App.


# Getting started
If you find a security vulnerability, feel free to open an issue.
To contribute actual code: 

1. Create your own fork of the code
2. Do the changes in your fork
3. If you like the change and think the project could use it:
    * Be sure you have followed the code style for the project.
    * Make Pull Request.
    
# Code review process
I look at Pull Requests on a regular basis, and respond at maximum of 72 hours. After feedback has been given I expect responses within a week. And all things being equal, I merge the branch into the Master.
